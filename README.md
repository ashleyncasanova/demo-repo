hi!

I am testing to see if there are any problems after changing repo name.

Added `.gitignore` from `Python.gitignore` template [see here for more templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore)

created conda env using `conda create --prefix ./env pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`

conda environment was activated using `conda activate /Users/.../project-setup/env`

jupyter was added to the `env` folder using `conda install jupyter`

currently env takes up 2.17 GB of storage.
