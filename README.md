The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how to set up a project folder.

The `set_up.ipynb` notebook is a step-by-step guide, demonstrating how to create a project folder containing a .gitignore file, README.md file, and a conda environment, including relevant tools/packages.

Also included in the `set_up.ipynb` is a quick overview of how to share a project folder by creating a `.yml` file (basically a text file with instructions to tell conda how to set up an environment) and how to revert this file back into an environment.
